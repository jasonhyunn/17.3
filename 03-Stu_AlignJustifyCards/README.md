# Fix the Alignment

In this activity, you will adjust an HTML file so a webpage matches a given image.  You will be using Bootstrap's justify and align classes to accomplish this result.

## Instructions

- Take a few minutes to look over both the HTML and CSS code. 

- Adjust the code to accomplish the following.

    - The columns should be centered horizontally and vertically in the row.

    - The text and button should be centered in the card.  

    - The paragraph text should be justified to horizontally stretch across the card.

## Hints

- Refer to Bootstrap's Flex and Text Alignment documentation.

    - [Bootstrap Text Alignment](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/utilities/text/)

## Bonus

- Manually adjust the height of the center card to create extra space.  Then, align the text to the bottom of the card so that space exists between the image and all text.
